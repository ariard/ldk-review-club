## Notes

* The core component of LDK is the `ChannelManager`. This structure gathers the channels states and the pending messages (forward HTLCs, outbound payments, inbound payments) to be applied triggering a state transition.
* Beyond, `ChannelManager` holds on-chain data (e.g best block seen) and user setting (node config) as those fields alter the processing of the state transitions (e.g reject `OpenChannel` because `funding_satoshis` is under user's `min_funding_satoshis`).
* Zooming, 2 notable members of `ChannelManager` are `channel_state` and `per_peer_state`. `ChannelHodler` stores currently few different elements such as the channels, the HTLC to be forwarded and the LDK internal processing events. `PeerState` only stores the per-peer features flag for now.
* As of today, `ChannelHolder` is protected by a single `Mutex` requiring in-order processing of the events, and thus only one channel can execute state transition at the same time. [#1507](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1507) and the split-off [#1542](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1542) are WIP enabling better parallelization of LDK channel processing.

## Questions

1) What's the current processing flow from receiving an inbound message in `handle_message()` to sending to the appropriate `Channel`'s method ? How many locks are taken and when ?
2) This PR is moving the `HashMap<[u8; 32], Channel<Signer>>` from `ChannelHolder` to `PeerState`. What's the purpose of this move ? Does it change anything for a LDK user ?
3) Why introducing a new `id_to_peer` in `ChannelManager` ?
4) What is backward compatibility and what is LDK's project policy on structure serialization backward compatibility ?
5) The PR is using `FairRwLock` to protect `PeerState`. What are the advantages of `FairRwLock` compare to Rust's traditional `RwLock`.
6) What could be the future internal refactoring after this PR to achieve [#422](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/422) ?
7) Apart of HTLC/message processing, what are the other perfomance bottlenecks of a LN node ?
