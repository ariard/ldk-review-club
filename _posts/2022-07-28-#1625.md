## Notes

* LDK scoring infrastructure was introduced in [#1507](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1124/files). Previous attempts to capture a flexible scoring API have been explored in [#626](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/626). 
* Numerous improvements have been added to this subsystem with [#1197](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1197), [#1227](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1227),
[#1347](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1347), [#1375](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1375) and [#1555](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1555).
* This PR introduces the notion of historical tracking of the channel liquidity balances.

## Questions

1. What's the general steps of our routing algorithm `get_route()` ? At which step the scoring penalty interfers ?
2. What's the current scoring strategy implemented by `ProbabilisticScorerUsingTime` ? What are the key findings of [`Optimically Reliable & Cheap Payment Flows on the Lightning Network`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05322.pdf) ? What are the limitations ?
3. How the current `penalty_msat()` is computed ? How the bounds `min_liquidity_offset_msat` / `max_liquidity_offset_msat` applied in function of the routed `amount_msat` influence the result ?
4. What's the new `HistoricalBucketRangeTracker` aims to achieve in terms of payment reliability ?
5. How the current LDK probing interface [`send_probe()`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/4905df889498ec520932ea6684b0ffabbd226641/lightning/src/ln/channelmanager.rs#L2770) works ? What could be a LDK automatic probing strategy ? What are the limits of probing ?
6. [`ProbabilisticScorerUsingTime`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/4905df889498ec520932ea6684b0ffabbd226641/lightning/src/routing/scoring.rs#L299) works well for high-payment volume or actively probing nodes. This is limited for low-payment volume nodes. How this can be solved today ? Can we imagine a distributed and trust-minimized scoring algorithm in the future for such nodes ?
