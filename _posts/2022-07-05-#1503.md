## Notes

* In current Lightning, the [invoice](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/11-payment-encoding.md) protocol for payment request is communicated out-of-band.
* An upgrade of the payment protocol called [offers](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/798) has been proposed to enable new features : static invoices, refunds and proof of payer.
* Offers leverages few [components](https://bolt12.org/) such as Schnorr sigs and the [onion format](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/04-onion-routing.md) used to route HTLC.
* [#1503](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1503) introduces a new module `OnionMessenger` to receive and send onion messages, with an API matching the already existent `ChannelManager`.  The API design discussions already happened with [#1432](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1432).

## Questions

1) How the current onion format for HTLC payment works ? What the `hop_payloads` represent ?
2) How the construction of the new onion format `OnionPacket` differs ? What's the relationship with `BlindedRoute`, "control" TLVs and "data" TLVs  ?
3) The [blinded route](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/765) mechanism claims to hide the identity of the recipient. How it achieves ? Are they privacy leaks or deanonymization attacks ?
4) What [offers](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/798) offer as features and new payments flows ? How does it compare to LN-url ?
5) What could be efficient [rate-limitations](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2022-June/003623.html) for onion messages ?
6) What could be future use-case of `CustomHandler` and `CustomMessage<T>` ?
