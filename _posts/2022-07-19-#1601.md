## Notes

* Currently, the main HTLC forward mechanism of LDK is handled by `ChannelManager` the `process_forward_htlcs()` / `ChannelHolder::forward_htlcs`
* The routing policy checks as mandated by [BOLT4](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/04-onion-routing.md) is implemented in `decode_update_add_htlc_onion()`. While mandatory checks are required to avoid DoSy/weird HTLCs paralyzing liquidity or failing-quickly, our current interface does not allow to interrupt relay.   
* #1601 introduces a new event to allow LDK users to catchup events on the fly. The main-use serviced is [on-demand channel](https://github.com/BitcoinAndLightningLayerSpecs/lsp) operated by Lightning Service Providers.

## Questions 

1) What's the current HTLC flow from receiving an `update_add_htlc()` to outbound `send_htlc()` ? What actions do `process_pending_htlc_forward()` ? Why HTLCs are not currently processed from 
2) How the current flow for inbound payment works from the point where the payment is detected as [final](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/9d35026cb647128ddf9f9f815d5e09e2d67a28bd/lightning/src/ln/channelmanager.rs#L2204) ?
3) What's a [`fake_scid`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1311) and how the scid namespaces works ? Do you see any issue with this privacy-preserving scheme ?
4) The PR introduces a new `PendingInterceptedHTLC`, the serialization method `impl_writeable_tlv_based()`  requires all the fields to be `required` why not `optional` ?
5) What's the flow of on-demand channels ? How `fail_intercepted_payment()` and `forward_intercepted_payment()` would work in that context ? Why an intercepted payment might fail ?
6) What other use-cases could be implemented with #1601 (e.g [trampoline](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/836) or [`delay_my_htlc`](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1008) option ?
7) Can you think about any [probing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00333.pdf) or [jamming](https://github.com/t-bast/lightning-docs/blob/master/spam-prevention.md) vector we could introduce with this PR ?
