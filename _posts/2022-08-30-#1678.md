## Notes

* Chain monitoring is one of the most critical piece of infrastructure of a Lightning implementation. In LDK, the current main components are `ChannelMonitor`, `ChainMonitor` and `OnchainTxHandler`.
* The current modularity is the fruit of multiple refactors: [#462](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/462), [#649](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/649), [#681](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/681)
* With #1678, more fine-grained types of results are introduced to improve the fault-tolerance of LDK nodes.

## Questions

1. What's the complete set of actions managed by the `ChannelMonitor` component ?
2. How `ChannelMonitor` is integrating with `ChainMonitor` and how this component is interfacing with the rest of the node component through `chain::Watch` ?
3. What's the purpose of the `Persist` trait ? Why data persistence is critical and what are the fund risks in face of storage failure, chain events or counterparty transactions confirmation ?
4. This PR is building on top of #1106, which is removing the broadcast of the commitment transaction in case of permanent node failure ?
Is this change presenting trade-offs ?
5. This PR is introducing more fine-grained types of persist results: `UpdateComplete`, `UpdateInProgress`, `PermanentFailure`, what's the difference of persistence processing they're informing back to the interface methods caller ?
6. What's the difference between the [watchtower and the monitor replicas ideas](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/main/GLOSSARY.md) and how they would benefit from #1678 ?
